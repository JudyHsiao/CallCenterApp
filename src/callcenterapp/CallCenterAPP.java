/**
* The CallCenterApp program simulated numbers of concurrent calls enter to a call center 
* according to the following conditions:
* <ol>
* <li> you have a call center with three levels of employees: fresher, technical lead (TL), product manager (PM).
* <li> There can be multiple employees, but only one TL or PM. 
* <li> An incoming telephone call must be allocated to a fresher who is free. 
* <li> If no freshers are free, or if the current fresher is unable to solve the callerâ€™s problem (determined by a simple dice roll), he or she must escalate the call to technical lead.
* <li> If the TL is not free or not able to handle it, then the call should be escalated to the PM.
* <li> If the PM is not free, then the call would be ended.
* </ol>
